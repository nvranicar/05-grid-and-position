                This was probably the hardest assignment for me, as it was more of a puzzle than the others. One thing that really tripped me up here was not knowing that a single HTML element could have multiple classes. I assumed this was a syntax error, so I ended
                up deleting all the parent tags on these which ended up breaking a lot of things. This was probably a blessing in disguise, though, as it forced me to consult my classmates for help which is good for me, being such an independent person
                by nature.

                I remember feeling fairly comfortable doing this assignment, but at the same time kinda feeling like I was doing it all the wrong way. I see now that I actually was, but I of course didn't have the knowledge of flexbox back then to help me. This assignment
                definitely taught me how to use floats, but also why not to use them for certain things like a page header.

                This assignment was definitely the easiest so far, excluding the one I'm working on right now. It mostly felt like a review of the concepts we learned from the previous assignment, so I was able to consult that one as well as the in-class lesson to finish
                it very fast. I would say the biggest thing this assignment taught me was how to effectively use borders and make them look beautiful.

                This assignment was definitely a doozy, but having the whole weekend to work on it including Friday was a huge boon. On top of that, being an Overwatch player myself, the content was fun to build even though it got hard at times. The biggest thing this
                assignment taught me was how to use positioning, as well as how to properly group elements to minimize the amount of code I have to write.
